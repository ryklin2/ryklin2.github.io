                    <h2>AI Tools in My Design Process</h2>
                    <img src="assets/ai-tools.jpg" alt="Screenshots of AI tools used in my design process" class="blog-image">
                    <p>Throughout my HCI design journey, I've incorporated several AI tools to enhance my workflow and improve my design decisions. The primary AI assistants I've relied on include <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">Claude</a>, and <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Gemini</a>. Each of these tools offered unique advantages that helped streamline different aspects of my design process.</p>
                    <p>ChatGPT was instrumental in helping me draft written content, though I quickly learned that its output required significant editing to align with my personal voice and project needs. While helpful for generating initial ideas, the raw output often lacked the specificity and nuance my projects demanded. This taught me an important lesson: AI is best used as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human judgment.</p>

                    <h2>AI Hacks to Improve Design</h2>
                    <img src="assets/design-iterations.jpg" alt="Multiple design drafts created with AI assistance" class="blog-image">
                    <p>The most effective AI hack I discovered was creating multiple independent drafts of single pages and then comparing ideas from each version. This approach allowed me to see various interpretations and solutions to the same design problem, significantly expanding my creative horizons. By having AI generate different approaches to the same interface, I could cherry-pick the strongest elements from each and combine them into a more refined final product.</p>
                    <p>One interesting observation was that AI tools consistently struggled with providing balanced comparisons between design iterations. When asked to evaluate design improvements side-by-side, the AI would almost universally shower praise on the newer version, regardless of whether the changes were truly substantive. This tendency toward positivity bias reminded me of tech companies' marketing materials—like that recent YouTube article that spent 20 paragraphs essentially claiming they had invented gradient backgrounds.</p>

                    <h2>Personal Insights on AI in Design</h2>
                    <img src="assets/ai-debate.jpg" alt="Visualization of human-AI design collaboration" class="blog-image">
                    <p>In my experience, AI tools excel at creating trendy, popular UI designs that follow current conventions—which, admittedly, is often what keeps designers employed. However, they're less adept at truly understanding user-friendliness beyond surface-level best practices. The tools lack the human empathy and contextual understanding that drive genuinely innovative, user-centered design solutions.</p>
                    <p>I found AI particularly valuable as a brainstorming partner and design critic, especially when I didn't want to tie up team members with lengthy debates about design decisions. That said, I often wished for more critical feedback rather than constant positivity. A more balanced perspective that highlighted potential problems would be tremendously valuable during the iterative design process.</p>

                    <h2>The Balance of Human and Machine</h2>
                    <p>AI is fundamentally trained on observed human inputs, which presents both opportunities and limitations. Theoretically, you could train or fine-tune an AI on repositories and websites with UIs you admire, potentially creating a tool that could combine your favorite design elements effortlessly. However, this approach raises an important question: why invest substantial time and computational resources when directly adopting those design elements might be more efficient?</p>
                    <p>The true value of AI in design seems to lie not in generating the final product, but in expanding the realm of possibilities and challenging our thinking. It serves as an additional voice in the room—one with access to a vast library of design patterns and solutions, but lacking the nuanced understanding of human needs that drives truly exceptional design. Finding the right balance between leveraging AI's strengths while compensating for its limitations remains the key challenge for designers incorporating these tools into their workflow.</p>
