        <p><em>HCI Blog Series (3/9)</em></p>

        <section>
          <h2>From Idea to Solution</h2>
          <p>Following the insights from our user research, we focused on a common frustration: the overwhelming and disorganized process of finding schools and scholarships abroad. Students, parents, and families often don‚Äôt know where to start, what‚Äôs real, or how to afford it.</p>
          <p>Our final concept is a centralized web tool that simplifies this search. It lets users:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Search for schools based on location, cost, programs, or goals</li>
            <li>Explore detailed school pages with tailored information</li>
            <li>Discover relevant scholarships and visa requirements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We brainstormed multiple ideas, including chatbot assistance and a mobile-first app, but we dropped these for now due to time and technical scope. A searchable, flexible website with backend spiders for crawling and gathering information felt both impactful and feasible.</p>
          <p>Our decision directly stems from Blog 2‚Äôs research: users want <strong>clarity</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong>, and <strong>trustworthy info</strong>. Our interface concept focuses on delivering exactly that.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Behind the Scenes: Making the Concept Video</h2>
          <p>We approached the video with a simple but clear plan. We created a rough script based on user needs and walked through a short scenario: a student struggling to find study-abroad info and how our platform makes it easier.</p>

          <h3>Tools and Process</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Scriptwriting:</strong> A basic intro-problem-solution format</li>
            <li><strong>Storyboarding:</strong> Hand-drawn panels to guide visuals</li>
            <li><strong>Filming:</strong> Smartphone camera, tripod, and screen recordings</li>
            <li><strong>Editing:</strong> We used DaVinci Resolve and OBS for narration overlays</li>
          </ul>

          <p>One challenge was syncing audio and visuals, especially when switching from live-action to screen demo. We fixed this by narrating post-edit and cutting extra filler. Funny enough, one take was almost ruined by someone‚Äôs cat jumping onto the desk mid-recording‚Äîbut we kept the blooper as a potential outtake!</p>

          <p>This whole process made us realize how much storytelling is involved in even technical projects. It‚Äôs not just about the tool‚Äîit‚Äôs how you make people <em>feel</em> like it helps.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>The User Perspective</h2>
          <p>Our main users are international students and their families, but also parents researching options, and even counselors or advisors trying to guide people through this messy process.</p>
          <p>By aggregating and organizing school and scholarship data, we‚Äôre making this information <strong>visible, searchable, and less intimidating</strong>.</p>
          <p>We shared the concept with a few classmates, one of whom was actually applying for study abroad. Their feedback? ‚ÄúI wish this existed already.‚Äù That was a great sign.</p>
          <p>Of course, there are systems that exist already‚Äîcollege departments, national programs‚Äîbut those often overwhelm or confuse. If we‚Äôre successful, we may even disrupt parts of that system. Our tool would let students take back some control.</p>
