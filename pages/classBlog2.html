                <p><em>HCI Blog Series (2/9)</em></p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Framing the Problem ‚Äì A UI Built for One</h2>
                    <p>As a long-time World of Warcraft (WoW) player and creative technologist, I‚Äôve always found myself tinkering with my user interface to make it feel ‚Äújust right.‚Äù The issue I chose to investigate was very personal: the inconsistency and clutter of my WoW UI during group scenarios. Specifically, problems like VuhDo not displaying correctly when group sizes changed, my health bar and cooldowns being too scattered across the screen, and an overall lack of spatial clarity around my character.</p>
                    <p>Since I was designing this UI for myself, I was the user. That made this both easier and harder‚Äîon one hand, I had full access to the user‚Äôs thoughts; on the other, I had to be extra aware of my own biases and assumptions.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Research Process ‚Äì Turning Intuition into Insight</h2>
                    <h3>Starting Assumptions</h3>
                    <p>Initially, I assumed that I simply needed more screen space or better add-ons. I believed my main challenge was about maximizing efficiency. But as I started documenting how I actually used the UI, the real issues became clear: cognitive overload, poor visual hierarchy, and situational inconsistency were the culprits.</p>

                    <h3>Methods Used</h3>
                    <p>I adopted a mix of <strong>observation</strong>, <strong>self-recording</strong>, and a bit of <strong>usability testing</strong> by having two guildmates try my setup and give feedback.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I recorded a few raid sessions and skirmishes to review my eye movement and UI interactions.</li>
                        <li>I sketched different layout options and annotated moments of visual confusion or unnecessary delay.</li>
                        <li>I also kept a journal for a week, logging moments when I lost track of an ability, misread an HP bar, or missed a cooldown window.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>The biggest challenge was objectivity. I knew how the UI ‚Äúshould‚Äù work, so it was hard not to rationalize bad interactions. Letting others test the interface helped highlight friction points I‚Äôd stopped noticing.</p>

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I used a basic affinity diagram to cluster recurring issues like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Misalignment between high-priority elements (e.g., HP, cooldowns)</li>
                        <li>Obstruction of view due to overlapping indicators</li>
                        <li>UI breaking on group size change</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These patterns showed that what I thought was a technical issue (add-ons bugging out) was actually a <strong>design issue</strong> about prioritization and responsiveness.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Key Learnings ‚Äì The UI Is a Conversation</h2>
                    <p>What surprised me most was how much I overlooked in my own habits. I thought I wanted more information on screen, but I actually needed <em>less</em>‚Äîjust more focused.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Insight 1:</strong> My interface needed to adapt based on combat context, not remain static.</li>
                        <li><strong>Insight 2:</strong> Group changes required flexible UI containers‚Äînot fixed placements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Insight 3:</strong> Keeping my focus on the center of the screen improved performance and reaction time significantly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This reshaped my semester project. Rather than building a one-size-fits-all UI, I shifted to developing a <strong>modular UI framework</strong>‚Äîa flexible layout that could adjust based on player class, combat status, and group composition.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Beyond HCI ‚Äì Empathy, Focus, and Life Design</h2>
                    <p>User research has taught me more than I expected. The mindset of asking ‚ÄúWhat does this person need to succeed?‚Äù applies far beyond UI.</p>
                    <p>In everyday life, it has changed how I approach collaboration. I‚Äôm more attentive to how people interact with tools, spaces, and information. I don‚Äôt assume they think or process like I do.</p>
                    <p>Professionally, I see user-centered design as a core skill‚Äîwhether I end up in game development, tool-building, or creative direction. Designing from the user‚Äôs perspective doesn‚Äôt limit creativity; it grounds it in purpose.</p>
