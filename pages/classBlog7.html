        <p><em>HCI Blog Series (7/9)</em></p>

        <section>
          <h2>Building the Portfolio</h2>
          <p>We’re still catching up on some of the portfolio site, but it’s a basic Google Site setup—clean HTML with limited JavaScript support. It’s not fancy, but we made sure it’s usable, visually clean, and focused on telling our project story clearly. We tried to organize our user feedback clearly and show the site’s evolution throughout the semester with screenshots and links.</p>
          <p>The deck is coming together milestone by milestone. We’re organizing it by the key phases we submitted—research, wireframes, user testing, prototypes—so it tells a full design journey without overwhelming viewers with too much info at once.</p>
          <p>Storytelling played a huge role. For both the site and the slides, we tried to structure things like a narrative: Here’s what we set out to solve, here’s how users helped shape that, and here’s what the final result looks like.</p>

          <h2>Showcasing the Work</h2>
          <p>The hardest part wasn’t designing the app—it was explaining why it matters. Because at its core, our app is simple: it helps people find information. The backend and data-spidering are the hard parts. The front-end? That’s just clarity and access.</p>
          <p>That said, making a Google Search-style interface <em>look</em> finished is tricky. Everyone has strong expectations of what search tools should feel like. We leaned into that and didn’t overcomplicate it. It’s minimal by design.</p>
          <p>We were proud of how we organized feedback and showcased the iterative changes based on testing. Those comparison shots, evolution screens, and notes helped people see how much thought went into a product that looks simple.</p>

          <h2>Lessons in Presentation</h2>
          <p>Presenting design work is harder than it looks. I expected people to just understand what we built by looking—but that’s rarely the case. We had to guide them through the “why” at every step: Why this search layout? Why these buttons? Why this wording?</p>
          <p>One surprise was how much people responded to visual before-and-after comparisons. Even if the changes were small, it made the design feel thoughtful and polished. I’ll use that trick again in the future.</p>
          <p>Next time, I’d spend more time rehearsing the verbal explanation and keeping slides cleaner. Less text, more visuals, and keep the pace moving. That makes the whole thing feel more confident and professional.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Reflection and Growth</h2>
          <p>I didn’t expect to apply knowledge from games to HCI work—but things like player profiles in Magic: The Gathering (Timmy, Johnny, Spike) made me think differently about user personas. Or how players customize UIs in games when default settings don’t cut it. That stuck with me.</p>
          <p>I learned that presenting to non-designers means cutting the jargon and showing results. Show the user journey, show what changed based on feedback, and be honest about what didn’t go perfectly.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, I’ll bring this approach into any product or tool I design. Keep the presentation clear, clean, and centered on the user's story—not just the designer’s decisions.</p>
