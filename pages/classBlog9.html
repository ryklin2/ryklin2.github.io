                        No words to confuse<br>
                        Interface clear as water<br>
                        Touch and understand
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>If I could distill everything I've learned about UI design this semester into one lesson, it would be the essence of that haiku: simplicity is everything. The average user won't read instructions. In fact, they won't read anything at all if they can avoid it. Every word on your interface is a potential barrier to understanding.</p>
                    
                    <p>This course has been a rollercoaster of realizations, some affirming what I already suspected and others completely reshaping how I think about the relationship between humans and computers. As someone who primarily works with backend systems and gaming interfaces, this deep dive into HCI has broadened my perspective in unexpected ways.</p>

                    <h2>The Rollercoaster Ride</h2>
                    <p>Early in the semester, our team felt a bit targeted for our submission approach—dumping giant zip files containing everything mentioned in documents and discussed in class. Looking back, I realize this was a perfect example of misaligned expectations between users (us) and system designers (instructors). We interpreted the requirements one way, while the intended interpretation was different. A classic HCI problem!</p>
                    
                    <p>One particularly challenging aspect was creating web scrapers for our project. What seemed like a straightforward technical task quickly became a lesson in digital ethics—you inevitably step on people's toes when extracting data, even with the best intentions. This experience taught me that HCI isn't just about technical capabilities; it's about respecting boundaries in digital spaces.</p>
                    
                    <div class="quote-box">
                        "I think we should have assembled more hard-coded dummy data for our user tests, but we also had a much weaker image of what we wanted to make at the time."
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>This reflection captures one of my biggest realizations: the importance of having concrete examples when testing with users. Abstract discussions only get you so far; people need something tangible to interact with, even if it's simulated data. Had we created more mock-ups and dummy data sets early on, our test results might have been more insightful.</p>

                    <h2>What I Wish I Knew Before</h2>
                    <p>If I could go back to week one, I'd tell myself this: "Planning ahead in software makes things MUCH easier to change later on." This lesson has been hammered home not just in HCI, but in parallel classes like CSC 413. The time spent deliberating on architecture and interface design pays off exponentially when iterations inevitably come.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'd also tell my past self that my tendency to stop caring about optimization once a UI becomes "usable enough" is both a strength and weakness. It's a practical approach—after all, once something works, there's always other code to write—but in HCI, that middle ground between "functional" and "delightful" is where the magic happens.</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout computer science education, we're constantly pushed toward command-line interfaces and raw functionality. This course reminded me that most of the world doesn't operate that way. Outside my comfort zone of video games and web apps, I rarely thought deeply about interfaces. Now I find myself noticing HCI principles everywhere—from elevator buttons to microwave displays.</p>

                    <h2>A Letter to Future HCI Students</h2>
                    <div class="letter">
                        Dear Future HCI Explorer,<br><br>
                        
                        You're about to begin a journey that will change how you see every digital (and physical) interface around you. Fair warning: after this class, you'll never look at a website, app, or even a toaster the same way again.<br><br>
                        
                        Here's what I wish someone had told me:<br><br>
                        
                        1. Remember that your users won't read anything. Seriously. If they have to read to understand how to use your product, you've already lost.<br><br>
                        
                        2. When testing with users, give them something concrete to interact with. Theory and wireframes only go so far—people need to click, tap, and experience.<br><br>
                        
                        3. Plan meticulously before building. Every hour spent in planning saves ten in redevelopment.<br><br>
                        
                        4. Don't just make interfaces that work—strive for interfaces that disappear, becoming so intuitive that users forget they're interacting with technology at all.<br><br>
                        
                        5. When you feel your programmer brain taking over, asking "but is it efficient?", take a step back and ask instead, "but is it understandable?"<br><br>
                        
                        The reason HCI matters isn't technical—it's deeply human. We build technology to serve people, not the other way around.<br><br>
                        
                        Good luck,<br>
                        A Wiser (and Humbler) Designer

                <section>
                    <h2>HCI – What's the Magic?</h2>
                    <p>Why does HCI matter? I've come to believe it's because it represents the crucial intersection between what computers can do and what humans can understand. In my day job working with access control, I've seen firsthand that when security systems are too complex, users create workarounds that defeat the purpose entirely. The most sophisticated algorithm in the world is useless if people can't or won't use it properly.</p>
                    
                    <p>There's something almost philosophical about HCI—it reminds us that technology exists to serve human needs, not to showcase technical brilliance. I find myself thinking about this balance when I tinker with tkinter for quick GUI applications. It's not the flashiest framework, but it scales well with procedural tools and integrates nicely with newer technologies like large language models. Sometimes the simple button is still the best interface.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>As I leave this course, I'm taking with me a deeper appreciation for the invisible design that shapes our digital experiences. My background in fiction writing and gaming has always given me some intuition about user experience, but now I have frameworks and principles to articulate why certain designs work and others fail.</p>
                    
                    <p>Will I become an HCI specialist? Probably not. But these principles will inform everything I build from now on. Whether I'm designing game interfaces, security systems, or simple utility applications, I'll remember the fundamental truth of this field: behind every screen and button is a human being who just wants to accomplish something without reading a manual.</p>
                    
                    <p>And isn't that, after all, the whole point?</p>
