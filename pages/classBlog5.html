        <p><em>HCI Blog Series (5/9)</em></p>

        <section>
          <h2>Learning the Art of UI Design</h2>
          <p>Until now, I’d been thinking mostly in terms of ideas and research. The moment I opened Figma and saw the blank canvas</p>
          <p>Exciting? Sure. Intimidating? Very. UI design is where you stop talking about helping users—and actually start showing them something that helps.</p>
          <p>Of all the design principles, <strong>hierarchy</strong> and <strong>accessibility</strong> made the biggest impression. I’ve seen enough cluttered interfaces to know what not to do, but understanding *why* something feels clean or confusing—that was new. I found myself questioning my old habits, like centering everything (it turns out left-aligned info is often more usable!) and relying on color alone to guide users.</p>

          <h2>Designing the Medium-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
          <p>I used <strong>Figma</strong> for my prototype. At first, I was just dropping elements in and arranging them like a mood board. But then I started applying actual feedback and structure—turning those pieces into coherent screens.</p>
          <p>Our early wireframes were a mess—boxes everywhere, no visual rhythm. But as I applied our earlier user feedback (like the need for quick access to scholarship filters), the layout began to breathe and become fairly minimalist but still workable for mobile and desktop.</p>

          <p>Here’s a side-by-side evolution:</p>
          <img src="assets/before_after_ui.jpg" alt="Before and after comparisons of the UI screens" class="blog-image">

          <p>One of my idea we had trouble setting up was an tab in the comparison on user needs from earlier blogs. It pulls average tuition + cost-of-living tries to combine those factors for users. One classmate said it made the whole page feel more “real.”</p>

          <h2>Challenges & Breakthroughs</h2>
          <p>Biggest challenge? <strong>Navigation.</strong> I kept adding links, thinking more access meant better usability. But then I got lost in my own menu.</p>
          <p>I took a step back and asked, “What would I want to see first if I knew nothing?” That’s when I re-centered the homepage to feature three primary flows: Search, Scholarships, and Compare Schools. Everything else moved into a secondary menu.</p>
          <p>One of the most surprising moments came when I swapped the “school card” layout based on someone’s casual remark: “It looks too academic, like I’m reading a form.” I turned that card into a more inviting panel with icons, highlights, and a short blurb—and suddenly it clicked.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Personal Reflection: Designing for the User</h2>
          <p>This process taught me that UI design isn’t just about looking nice it’s about <strong>feeling right</strong> for someone who needs it. Every button and layout choice asks the same question: “Will this make someone’s life easier?”</p>
          <p>I used to think UI was just decoration on top of function. Now I see it as the bridge. It <em>is</em> the interaction. It’s where the idea meets the human.</p>
          <p>If I could go back and tell myself one thing, it would be: <em>Sketch messy. Test fast. And never get too attached  with your first version.</em> Iteration is good, but frankly no one was complaining with what we got going from medium to high fi.</p>
