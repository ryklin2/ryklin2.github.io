                    <h2>The Spark That Ignited My Interest</h2>
                    <img src="assets/workspace.jpg" alt="My workspace setup showing the tools I use daily" class="blog-image">
                    <p>As someone who spends considerable time both gaming and writing, my interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) naturally grew from my daily interactions with different user interfaces. From navigating complex MMO interfaces in World of Warcraft to using writing software for fiction, I've experienced firsthand how good design can either enhance or hinder creative expression.</p>
                    <p>My current work in access control has shown me another crucial aspect of HCI - the balance between security and usability. When a system is too complex, users find workarounds that compromise security. When it's too simple, it might not provide adequate protection. Finding this sweet spot has become a fascinating challenge in my professional life.</p>

                    <h2>HCI and Personal Growth</h2>
                    <img src="assets/journey.jpg" alt="A visual representation of my learning journey" class="blog-image">
                    <p>As a student at SFSU with a passion for creative work and storytelling, I see HCI as a bridge between technical functionality and human experience. Whether it's designing game interfaces or writing tools, understanding HCI principles can help create more immersive and intuitive experiences for users.</p>
                    <p>My background in fiction writing has taught me the importance of perspective and empathy - skills that translate directly to user-centered design. Just as a writer must understand their readers, a good HCI designer must understand their users' needs, limitations, and expectations.</p>

                    <h2>My Semester Project: Gaming Accessibility</h2>
                    <img src="assets/prototype.jpg" alt="Early sketch of my project concept" class="blog-image">
                    <p>For my semester project, I'm focusing on improving game accessibility for players with different needs. Inspired by my experience with various games (recently playing Falcom games, OneShot, La Mulana, and others), I've noticed how interface design can either welcome or alienate players.</p>
                    <p>The project aims to develop a framework for adaptable gaming interfaces that can accommodate different player needs without compromising the core gaming experience. By the end of the semester, I hope to create a prototype that demonstrates how thoughtful interface design can make games more accessible while maintaining their challenge and engagement.</p>

                    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                    <p>This journey into HCI aligns perfectly with my interests in game programming and storytelling. By understanding how humans interact with technology, I can better create experiences that engage and inspire users, whether through games, writing tools, or other interactive media.</p>
                    <p>The skills I develop in this course will not only enhance my ability to create more user-friendly systems but also deepen my understanding of how technology can better serve human needs and creativity.</p>
