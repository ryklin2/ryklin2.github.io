                <h2>The Spark That Ignited My Interest</h2>

                <p>My fascination with Human-Computer Interaction began with something we all do countless times each day - unlocking our smartphones. What seems like a simple action is actually a carefully designed interaction that balances security with convenience. This daily experience made me realize how much thought goes into making technology feel natural and intuitive.</p>
                <p>In my own life, I've noticed how good design can make or break an experience. Recently, while helping my parents navigate their new smart home system, I witnessed firsthand the importance of user-friendly interfaces. What was intuitive for me proved challenging for them, highlighting the critical need for inclusive design that considers users of all backgrounds and abilities.</p>

                <h2>HCI and Personal Growth</h2>
                <img src="assets/journey.jpg" alt="A visual representation of my learning journey" class="blog-image">
                <p>Learning about HCI isn't just about understanding interfaces - it's about developing a deeper empathy for how people interact with technology. As I progress in this field, I'm becoming more observant of the subtle ways design impacts our daily lives. This awareness is shaping my dream of becoming a designer who creates technology that truly serves human needs.</p>
                <p>The principles of HCI align perfectly with my personal goal of making technology more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. Whether it's designing a website that works seamlessly for both tech-savvy teenagers and their grandparents, or creating apps that adapt to different learning styles, HCI provides the framework to turn these aspirations into reality.</p>

                <h2>My Semester Project: Bridging Generations Through Technology</h2>
                <img src="assets/prototype.jpg" alt="Early sketch of my project concept" class="blog-image">
                <p>For my semester project, I'm developing an interactive platform that helps senior citizens connect with their families through simplified video calling and photo sharing. This idea stems from watching my own grandparents struggle with existing communication apps, despite their strong desire to stay connected with family.</p>
                <p>The project is deeply meaningful to me because it addresses a real need I've observed in my own family. By the end of this semester, I hope to create a prototype that demonstrates how thoughtful interface design can bridge the technological gap between generations. Success, for me, would mean creating something that my grandparents could use independently and confidently.</p>

                <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                <p>As I embark on this journey in HCI, I'm excited about the potential to create technology that doesn't just work well, but truly enriches people's lives. Through this course, I hope to gain not only technical skills but also a deeper understanding of how to design with empathy and purpose.</p>
                <p>The road ahead involves learning about user research, prototyping, and evaluation methods. But more importantly, it's about understanding the human side of technology - the emotions, frustrations, and joys that come with using digital tools in our daily lives.</p>
